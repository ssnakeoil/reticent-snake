    "{i}For the last few weeks, even.{/i}"
    "{i}Thankfully, someone had seen him breaking in and called the cops. They arrived just moments after you had woken up and scared the man out of your apartment before he could do anything.{/i}"
    "{i}Unfortunately, he couldn't be caught, and you had not seen his face in the dark of your room.{/i}"
    pov "Ugh..."
    "{i}On behalf of the events that took place, your friend Linus was kind enough to hire you a bodyguard for a month.{/i}"
    "{i}Something you were not very excited about.{/i}"

    pov "Yes, of course."

    "{i}His hands were in his pockets, and he was leaning leisurely against the car.{/i}"
    "{i}In all fairness, he was attractive... and you've always wondered what it would be like to have a personal bodyguard.{/i}"
    b "Not to rush you, but I might be in for a parking violation if we continue to stand around."
    pov "Alright. Then, let's go."
    "{i}He looked flustered at your quickness.{/i}"

    ###Fade to black
    
    "{i}Before long, you were on the freeway, likely heading to your home.{/i}"
    "{i}The seats were warm... but instead of soothing you, it allowed your mind to wander to darker places.{/i}"
    "{i}You didn't know this road.{/i}"
    "{i}It was also possible that he was taking you to one of the hotels or suites that were close to your apartment complex.{/i}"
    "{i}Or you could be on the way to your death.{/i}"

    b "How do you know Linus?"
    pov "We grew up together. You?"
    b "We were buddies at academy."
    "{i}He chuckled, probably remembering something that they'd done together.{/i}"
    "{i}You weren't really in the mood for conversation at the moment, and he seemed to feel it. The conversation stopped there.{/i}"
    "{i}He turned on the radio to make up for the break in conversation.{/i}"
    "{i}You turned your attention to the window, watching the lights as you sped by.{/i}"
    "{i}It wasn't until about a half hour later that Beau spoke up again catching you before you slipped out of consciousness.{/i}"
    b "He told me about you earlier."
    pov "Told... you about me?"
    "{i}He nodded.{/i}"
    pov "Linus?"
    b "He said you weren't going to be easy to deal with."
    "{i}You scoffed. To be expected from him.{/i}"
    pov "...That bitch."
    "{i}The comment earned you another chuckle.{/i}"
    b "Honestly, you seem to give him a hard time. {w}Not that that's necessarily a bad thing."
    b "If he's anything like he was back then, I certainly wouldn't blame you."
    pov "He's just... too overbearing."
    "{i}Of course, it was more than that, but it's not like you were just going to out and tell him the details.{/i}"
    b "I guess you'll be giving me a hard time too, then."
    "{i}You were glad that he didn't press the issue, and breathed a silent sigh of relief. One he probably couldn't see in the dark.{/i}"
    pov "Probably."
    b "At least you're honest."
    
    ####Fade to black
    
    "{i}Before you knew it, you were fast asleep.{/i}"
    "{i}When you woke up, you were warm. You could smell cologne. You were rocking...{/i}"
    pov "...Beau?"
    "{i}You opened an eye to see Beau. He flashed you a smile you couldn't help but reciprocate and it took you a second to realize he was carrying you.{/i}"
    b "I can carry you. I can put you down if you'll have to wait until we're off the stairs."
    "{i}The smell of cologne continued to invade your sense of smell; it was a stress relieving fragrance. Eucalyptus?{/i}"
    "{i}Eucalyptus was your personal favorite. You briefly wondered if Linus had somehow told him to wear it, but shook the thought from your mind.{/i}"
    pov "Must be difficult to go up the stairs with my potato self in your arms."
    b "Oh, please. If anyone is the potato here, it's me."
    "{i}You laughed, looking up at him. You didn't expect him to be looking at you. He winked when you made eye contact.{/i}"
    "{i}You cringed inwardly, but your face felt hot.{/i}"
    "{i}Once he opened the door to your floor, you gave him a pat on the shoulder.{/i}"
    pov "I think that I can take it from here."
    b "Of course."
    "{i}He set you down oh-so-gently e{/i}"
    pov "Where are you going to sleep? {w}Not with me, right?"
    "{i}He took a seat across from the bed.{/i}"
    pov "We're not sharing this room, are we?"
    b "You asked the same question in two different ways in under 10 seconds seconds. Amazing."
    pov "But really."
    b "There's a fold-out bed that I'll be using."
    "{i}So you were sharing the room.{/i}"
    b "I don't actually believe that your stalker would know this location, but I don't really want to take any chances."
    pov "Aren't you supposed to be keeping stuff like that to yourself. You know, so that you don't worry me?"
    b "You don't look very worried to me, [povname]. However, you seem to be the type who would feel more at ease if you knew what was going on."
    pov "Would it be okay if I asked you where we were then?"
    b "We're at a hotel on the outskirts of town. It's about forty, forty-five minutes away from your hospital."
    b "Ah, right. You're going to have to account for the forty-five minute deficit by waking up earlier."
    "{i}You bit back a complaint, but knew he was right. He must have known what he was doing.{/i}"
    pov "Of course."
    "{i}A string of other complaints flew through your mind as he continued to speak.{/i}"
    b "I'm going to give you a stun gun. Make sure not to touch this metal part right here when you press the trigger."
    b "Try to aim for the neck, or groin area. If you can't get to those, under the arms, or under the ribcage."
    b "Hold it there until you can break away."
    "{i}He put the stun gun in your hand after his animated demonstration of how to put all of what he said into action.{/i}"
    "{i}It was a pink shark... The tail flipped off to reveal intimidating metal prongs.{/i}"
    pov "Is this really a stun gun?"
    b "Yes, ma'am."
    pov "And it will tase people? ...Not for pretend, right?"
    b "It's not supposed to look like a taser, but I assure you. It is one."
    pov "Okay, serious follow up question: what if I'm touching the person I tase?"
    b "Nothing. The current won't travel."
    pov "Okay. {w}Nice. {w}Cool."
    pov "..."
    "{i}Beau put a comforting hand on your shoulder and the cloud in your mind lifted.{/i}"
    "{i}Apparently, you'd been stading with the little shark taser in your hand saying variations of \"nice,\" \"cool,\" and \"okay,\" for... {w}a lot longer than you thought you were.{/i}"
    "{i}You could hear your heart beating in your ears for the first time and were not sure if you were excited or a little freaked out.{/i}"
    b "Hey. Look at me."
    pov "Okay..."
    b "I'm giving this to you as a precaution. We're going to hope that you don't need to use it, but in the event that you need it, it'll be right there."
    pov "Right."
    b "I'm here for you, too."
    pov "Yes..."
    b "I think it's time for bed. Should I step out while you get ready?"
    pov "No, stay. Please."
    pov "I'm going to take a shower anyway."
    "{i}Hopefully, that will calm your nerves.{/i}"
    "{i}And there was no getting away from the fact that you felt safer with him around.{/i}"
    pov "I trust you won't peak."
    b "Of course not. I will be a perfect gentleman."
    b "Call me if you need anything. Or yell if you change your mind about wanting me in your room."
